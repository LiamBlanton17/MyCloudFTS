My Cloud File Transfer Service, or MyCloudFTS, is a web application targeted at small to medium sized teams in need of a simple cloud-based file management service. Highlights of the application include a simple administrative and user-permission system, support for a wide range of file types that may not always be supported by other file management services, and a clean, simple UI. The niche this web application hopes to serve is teams who either need support for rare file types or donâ€™t want to deal with the complexity of other file management services.

The tech stack for this application is below.
Nginx/Gunicorn
Python/Django + PostgreSQL
HTML/CSS/TypeScript + Bootstrap/JQuery
C (if deemed necessary to improve performance)
